From the above chart we can depict that the bar graph between the bodymass and species having categories and sub categories. 
*What happened when you removed the outer parentheses from the code? Why?*
Removing the outer parentheses in a function call leads to a syntax error because the function call is not properly formatted.


## Observable and Vega-Lite

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`?*


markCircle(),using a circle rather than a mark, you can emphasize anything.To indicate or highlight anything as having a square shape, use the markSquare() function. 

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markPoint()`?*


MarkPoint() can be used for specific representation in addition to markCircle(), which represents the highlighted part in small circles.

*What change do you need to make to swap the x and y axes on the scatterplot?*

vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower") vl.y().fieldQ("Miles_per_Gallon") should be replaced by vl.y().fieldQ("Horsepower") vl.x().fieldQ("Miles_per_Gallon") to swap the x and y axes .

*Insert the bar chart image here*

*Why do you think this chart is the result of this code change?*
The y-axis, represented by vl.y(), is missing as a result of the code modification.Only this x-axis, which displays the record count, is visible when fieldN("Origin") is used.
